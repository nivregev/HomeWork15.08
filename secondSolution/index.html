      Why We Say Yes and The Difference Between Yes and No
    </h1>
    <div id="why-yes" class="w-75 mx-auto mt-3">
      We agree to many requests not because we want to do them, but because we
      don't want to be seen as rude, arrogant, or unhelpful. Often, you have to
      consider saying no to someone you will interact with again in the
      future—your co-worker, your spouse, your family and friends. Saying no to
      these people can be particularly difficult because we like them and want
      to support them. (Not to mention, we often need their help too.)
      Collaborating with others is an important element of life. The thought of
      straining the relationship outweighs the commitment of our time and
      energy. For this reason, it can be helpful to be gracious in your
      response. Do whatever favors you can, and be warm-hearted and direct when
      you have to say no. But even after we have accounted for these social
      considerations, many of us still seem to do a poor job of managing the
      tradeoff between yes and no. We find ourselves over-committed to things
      that don't meaningfully improve or support those around us, and certainly
      don't improve our own lives. Perhaps one issue is how we think about the
      meaning of yes and no. The Difference Between Yes and No The words “yes”
      and “no” get used in comparison to each other so often that it feels like
      they carry equal weight in conversation. In reality, they are not just
      opposite in meaning, but of entirely different magnitudes in commitment.
      When you say no, you are only saying no to one option. When you say yes,
      you are saying no to every other option. I like how the economist Tim
      Harford put it, “Every time we say yes to a request, we are also saying no
      to anything else we might accomplish with the time.” Once you have
      committed to something, you have already decided how that future block of
      time will be spent. In other words, saying no saves you time in the
      future. Saying yes costs you time in the future. No is a form of time
      credit. You retain the ability to spend your future time however you want.
      Yes is a form of time debt. You have to pay back your commitment at some
      point. No is a decision. Yes is a responsibility.
